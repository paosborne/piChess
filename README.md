Raspberry Pi Chess Computer

Goal to make a 1980's style chess computer using a Raspberry Pi.    

This is a labour of love, no rush just gently tinkering as and when I get time which is usually half an hour here and there.

This project blatantly uses ChessBoard found at: http://pygame.org/   with GPL - so my backside is covered.

The bulk of my code is in interface.py this is the bit that talks between a real physical chess board, the chess engine (stockfish), Chessboard.py (used to validate the human moves and referee the game) and the human player.

This is the first bit of python I have written, its not pretty to be honest and I am learning as I go along.
