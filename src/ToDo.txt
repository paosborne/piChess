Todo list
=========

BUGS:
MAJOR:
DONE 1. pawn promotion handling 
DONE 2. FEN string extraction issue in ChessBoard.py

MINOR:
Occasionaly the engine returns a null response which is invalid.
  No idea why, but it seems to be every few hundred games so 
  I am going to bung that as a low risk bug


==========================================================

Hardware:
DONE:  handle the LEDs
add 2 LEDs for B/W
handle the LCD display
handle the board switches
handle control switches
On off switch?

===========================================================

Sofware:
Change engine to stockfish5 so we can use an opening book?
Turn off pi mid game and save game state (FEN and move list)
Turn on pi and autoload saved game state (FEN and move list)
Set initial level of play
add a pause into each level as it plays - illusion of thinking...
remove the double LED on/off
remove debug messages from pawn promotion (runs twice)
DONE:changing level
DONE:style of play
Ensure stockfish is killed on game exit

Wish list:
Setup game position 
position fen rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
Run an analysis mode?
